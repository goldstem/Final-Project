this is a weapons database that uses the in game weapons from destiny 2 to sort and inform people of different weapon types: Rarity  , Element , Ammo Type , and what season the weapon was added in.

This website includes a search function that lets the user specify via a drop down menu which of the sort options they want. It then allows the user to manually type out what specific thing they want to look for in previously specified category.

This website also includes a List tab that provides the user pre made loadouts for many events within destiny 2. For example Raids , Dungeons , Open World , and PVP.
