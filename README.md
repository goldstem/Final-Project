This is a database and loadout creator for the game Destiny 2. Weapons have attributes: Img, Name, Type, Rarity, Element, Ammo Type, season the weapon was added in, flavor text, as well as two arrays of perks.

This website includes a search function that lets the user specify via a drop down menu which of the sort options they want. It then allows the user to manually type out what specific thing they want to look for in previously specified category, and these items will be added/removed from the DOM as the user types.

Each weapon in the database has a button that will expand the tab and show the flavor text and perks.

This website also includes a List tab that allows the user to make a loadout consisting of a primary, secondary, and heavy weapon.

To add: loadout naming, premade loadouts, loadout discriptions.
